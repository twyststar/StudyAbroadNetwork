League Spartan
=============

**A new classic, this is a bold, modern, geometric sans-serif that has no problem kicking its enemies in the chest.** 

Taking a strong influence from ATF's classic Spartan family, we're starting our own family out with a single strong weight. We've put a few unique touches into a beautiful, historical typeface, and made sure to include an extensive characterset – currently totaling over 300 glyphs. Over time, the open-source license will allow us expand into League Spartan into a full family, with multiple weights and styles, and we're starting by releasing our first Bold style for this exciting, modern classic now.

_In addition, the incredible [Philip von Borries](https://www.vaubee.com) has crafted a beautiful and detailed animated version of League Spartan to accompany the release – partnering with [Animography.net](https://animography.net/products/league-spartan) to expand on it and sell it._

_It's simple and beautiful, and makes some extremely complex, very compelling typographic animations quickly._

_And part of the profits are going right back into supporting The League and making more great stuff, so if you love it, [grab a license today](https://animography.net/products/league-spartan)._
