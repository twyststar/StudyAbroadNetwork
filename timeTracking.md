## It looks like we will need an API to send the emails

* Plain HTML/CSS/JS/Jquery cannot send mail, it can only provide a mailto link - this will only open a user's mail service and allow them to send a free form email. It fails if the settings on your device don't have a default mail service, and it will not allow us to gather the information we want or (possibly) send a from reply email.
* Because of the above, I will build out a nodeJS service that will run separately to handle parsing form input and sending out an email. (An API)
* Current plan is to use NodeMailer and heroku.

_Current status - local api has successfully delivered a test email._

* Need to build out form, format email, and connect the information to the api.
* Need to push API live after the above
* Currently finishing out the content for Canada before returning to this

---

* Refactor of existing districts to show individual schools (or top schools in the case of more than ~10)
  * [x]- BC complete

* Refactor videos for load on click to speed up page load
  * [x]- Existing videos for all BC are refactored to load on click. Function tested, will be used going forward.

#### ToDo FOr MVP(minimum viable product/ok to go live for users)


* Complete remaining sections/districts (details in emails)

* API (brief notes above)

* Set up USA/NZ with coming soon messages

* Build a 'back' or 'close' type button to ease navigation from an open district

* A bunch of small style/usability fixes, detailed in my notes

#### Stretch/future possible additions

* Format images to uniform size to ease load times (this will take some time in Photoshop - the files themselves need adjusting in order to change load)

* Hook app to a database to track contacts

* Find cools ways to create a 'favorite' or 'compare' list of schools/districts - _this would be a big project, likely requiring a pretty large refactor_

* If db implemented, create admin dashboard for ease of information visibility - _this would be a separate app, for Aunt Alex's use, connected to the database_
