    With one of the longest coastlines, vast wilderness, world-class cities, and a culture of tolerance and diversity,
    Canada is a natural destination for thousands of international students.

    <p class="pb-3">
    One of the biggest reasons students choose to come to Canada is the quality of a Canadian education. A Canadian degree
    is widely recognized as equal to one from the United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom.

    Canada is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low crime rate. In terms of social progress and development,
    according to Global News, Canada was ranked the second country in the world with the highest quality of life.</p>

              Pembina Trails School Division is a public school division governed by an elected Board of Trustees. Some of our schools are French Immersion which means the students have the option of their classes being taught in the French language. The schools cover a large geographic area in the southwest corner of the City of Winnipeg. Each school has a gym and other sporting facilities that support a strong physical education program. Theaters, art studios, dance studios and band rooms are also available for those students interested in the fine arts. We also have technology and industrial arts facilities (e.g. woodworking, metalworking, electronics) for those students who enjoy "hands-on" courses. libraries and computer labs. Pembina Trails School Division takes great pride in its IT Department and use of technology in the classroom.

              Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the friendliest and safest places in North America. A place where laughter is a
              recurring theme; a place where its people are recognized for their hospitality, warmth, and love of music and culture.
              This is where you may look up to examine a high-rise building, pause to smell the roses, all without the shoving and
              pushing of time-starved city-walkers.
            </em></p>
          <p><em>
              Schools throughout the province offer a curriculum recognized and supported by the Provincial Department of Education
              including AP and IB selections.
