    <h2 class="text-center pt-3 pb-5"><i class="fab flag-icon fa-canadian-maple-leaf fa-2x"></i><br> Canada: As of September 2020</h2>
    
    <p class="pb-3">The Canadian Government has extended the current travel restrictions to September 30, 2020. Any student who does not have a study permit or a letter of confirmation of study permit issued before March 18th does not qualify to travel to Canada. Students travelling with eTA’s do not currently qualify either. We are happy to accept applications for the second semester, starting in late January. Should the border opening not improve by then, most schools will issue a full refund of paid fees minus the application fee. ( Usually between $ 200.00 - $ 500.00 Canadian)</p>

    <h2 class="text-center pt-3 pb-5"><i class="fab flag-icon fas fa-flag-usa fa-2x"></i><br>USA: F and M students and schools certified by SEVP should abide by guidance issued in March 2020.</h2>
    
    <p class="pb-3">The guidance enables schools and students to engage in distance learning in excess of regulatory limits due to the public health emergency generated by COVID-19. The March 2020 guidance applies to nonimmigrant students who were actively enrolled at a U.S. school on March 9 and are otherwise complying with the terms of their nonimmigrant status, whether from inside the U.S. or abroad. SEVP will not issue a temporary final rule impacting nonimmigrant students for the fall school term.</p>
    <p class="pb-3">In accordance with March 2020 guidance, nonimmigrant students in new or initial status after March 9 will not be able to enter the U.S. to enroll in a U.S. school as a nonimmigrant student for the fall term to pursue a full course of study that is 100 percent online. Additionally, designated school officials should not issue a Form I-20 to a nonimmigrant student in new or initial status who is outside of the U.S. and plans to take classes at an SEVP-certified educational institution fully online.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center pt-3 pb-5"><i class="fab flag-icon fas fa-kiwi-bird fa-2x"></i><br>New Zealand</h2>
    
    <p class="pb-3">New Zealand’s border is closed to most travellers and entry is strictly controlled. Student visa holders can no longer enter New Zealand. Exceptions to the border closure can be made by Immigration New Zealand for exceptional circumstances only.
