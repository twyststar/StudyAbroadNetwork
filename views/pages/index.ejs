          <img src="assets/images/alexHeadShot.png" alt="Alexandra Anderson" class="roundSmallPic">
          <p>My name is Alexandra Anderson and I am the owner of Study Abroad Network.</p>
          <p>I started working with High School students wanting to study abroad over 7 years ago. Coming from the travel
          industry, I was very excited to have the opportunity to help find the perfect study abroad program and places for High
          School students.</p>
          <p>My first experience with students was working for an Agency in Germany. We sent students to study in Canada, the United
          States, New Zealand and Australia. After I moved to the USA, I developed a Canada High School program for a large international Education Company.</p>
          <p>Last year, I decided to get away from large student numbers and focus on personalized service for each student
          wanting to study abroad.</p>
          <p>I will be your personal guide, from when you first contact me, through the program's completion. I will guide you through the school selection and the application process, I will assist with preparation for departure, and provide support while you are away from home.</p>
          <p>It can be challenging to find the right Agency or person to help you make a good decision about your future school and
          location. I have travelled to many places and schools in Canada and the USA, always staying in close contact with the schools and students to provide a personalized service. I might be the right advisor for you.</p>
          <p>I speak English and German.</p>
          <p>My focus is to find the perfect location for you to experience an unforgettable adventure studying abroad.</p>
