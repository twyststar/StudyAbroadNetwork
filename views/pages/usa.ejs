    <h2 class="text-center pt-3 pb-5">The USA has the worldâ€™s largest international student population, with more than 1,000,000 students choosing to broaden

    <p class="pb-3">
    US schools place great significance on diversity, meaning classes will consist of students of all ages, religions, and
    countries of origin.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="assets/images/network1.png" alt="network icon">
    <p class="pb-3"> The United States provides a stimulating and rich learning environment which encourages cross-cultural
    understanding and networking.</p>

    <p class="pb-3">One of the major potential benefits if you study high school in the USA may be the chance
    to be immersed in the English language in a real classroom.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="assets/images/booksIcon.png" alt="language icon">
    <p class="pb-3">
    If you decide to study abroad high school in the USA you may
    take courses in areas like English, history, science, math, social studies and computer science.</p>

    <img class="smallIcon" src="assets/images/starIcon.png" alt="language icon">
    <p>
    U.S. public high schools only allow international students to study for one year, but private schools do not limit the
    length of enrollment.</p>
